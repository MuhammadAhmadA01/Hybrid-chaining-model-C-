# Hybrid-chaining-model-C-

**Overview**

The Hybrid Chaining Model is a novel hashing algorithm designed for efficient storage of numerical data. This algorithm employs an AVL tree to store keys and a binary search tree (BST) to store the corresponding values. The entire process is visualized using C++ and BGI graphics, providing a clear representation of the insertion and searching processes.

**Features**

**Efficient Data Storage:** Utilizes a hybrid chaining model with AVL tree for keys and binary search tree for values, optimizing storage and retrieval operations.
**Visualization:** The entire process of inserting and searching elements is visually represented, allowing users to understand the algorithm's inner workings.
**Interactive User Interface:** Built using C++ and BGI graphics, providing a user-friendly interface within Visual Studio.

**Technologies Used**

**C++:** Programming language used for implementing the Hybrid Chaining Model.
**BGI Graphics:** Library for graphics in C++.
**Visual Studio:** Integrated development environment (IDE) for C++ development.
